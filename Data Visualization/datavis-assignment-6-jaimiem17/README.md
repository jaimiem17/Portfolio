Author: Jaimie Morris


In this repository, you will find:

* index.html -- html driver that includes d3 and (list any other files it requires. Also specify any parameters used, preferred browsers or any instructions for running/building your visualization, as needed.)
* d3.v7.min.js  -- d3 v7
* plot.js -- In my plot I created a Treemap with different buttons that could change and modify the design of the map.
* (list any other files in your repo with a brief description)
* plot2.js -- another plot I created to work on adaptive from a different view


(describe any known bugs, idiosyncrasies, or behaviors that need you want noted. )
I tried to do the adaptive part by doing the first node as -best and then finding the new width and height then recumulating the sizes. I tried to map the current x's and y's but it was difficult to follow which was needed for the incoming node. Still does not work but it worked with a very small treemap! Hope it somewhat makes sense what I was doing - I'd like to think I was close to getting it.
