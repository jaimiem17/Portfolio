    <h4>2. Data Abstraction from "The Fallen of WWII"</h4>

    <p id="Q2">
      I was a little bit unsure of the dataset but at first I'd say that it is an example of a Set because the idea was
      to just use the item, a person's figure, to represent the amount of casualities of the war without any order or
      specifity of placement. Later in the video the data started resembling more of a barchart/table like dataset
      because there were attributes under each set of data and the height/amount of items were still representing the
      casualities but they were categorized. Each item in the dataset represents a death in WWII. A categorical
      attribute were the countries that were shown in the video. The quantitative-ratio attribute was the amount of
      casualities. An ordinal attribute was the years shown on the timeline of the war. Another attribute was the difference
      in casualties of US soldiers that died from fighting the Nazis vs fighting the Japanese. This is quantitative-ratio.
      The people that the US fought specifically, the Japanese and Nazis, are also categorical attributes. From the data shown, 
      I can derive that the amount a Nazi deaths were the Germany deaths plus the data from Hungary, Romania, and Italy
      because those countaries were labeled as Nazi axis powers as well.
