In this repository, you will find:

index.html -- html driver that includes d3 and (list any other files it requires. Also specify any parameters used or any instructions for running/building your visualization, as needed.)
d3.v7.min.js -- d3 v7
plot.js -- Creates parallel coordinates plot with interaction and brushing
(describe any known bugs, idiosyncrasies, or behaviors that need you want noted. )

I could not get the brushing to work. I understand that every time I run isSelected it is returning false since not all burshes are active and I am nnot sure how to check if any brush is active or if that brush is active for just that specific axis. Without this problem the rest of the code should run well.
