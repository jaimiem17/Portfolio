CMPS-3360 Assignment 3
------------

Author: Jaimie Morris


In this repository, you will find:

* index.html -- html driver that includes d3 and (list any other files it requires. Also specify any parameters used or any instructions for running/building your visualization, as needed.)
* d3.v7.min.js  -- d3 v7
* plot.js -- This file has a function that takes in a plot and data as parameters and creates a scatterplot with axes and d3 interaction
* (list any other files in your repo with a brief description)


(describe any known bugs, idiosyncrasies, or behaviors that need you want noted. )

This assignment was definitely challenging to say the least. Without any knowledge on brushing, tables, interactions with d3, or even learning how to pass data as a parameter from an array, it took a lot of hours of researching with no direct guide on how to do any of those. The brushing document was somewhat helpful but was not posted until the day the assignment was due so most of my work was done prior to that. Because I am new to JavaScript I found this assignment hard to complete on my own and I hope in the future you could possibly link some video help or more smaller practice tasks. The links posted were somewhat helpful but they don't explain it all that well and it would be nice to do some in person practice if there is time at the beginning/end of class. I also found the spec doc a little bit hard to understand and possibly some more examples of what is being looked for would be helpful too!!

Sorry I made this into a whole review/critque-- I hope you understand where I am coming from! Thank you
