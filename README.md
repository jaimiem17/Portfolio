# 🎒Jaimie’s Schoolwork Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to my academic archive — a collection of code, projects, and experiments from my journey as an IT & Computer Science student at Tulane University (with a Biomedical Engineering minor).

## 📚 What This Repo Is

This is **not** a polished, cohesive portfolio — it's more like a digital backpack dump. You'll find:

- 🧠 CS assignments, labs, and mini-projects  
- 🔧 Random scripts and tools from IT classes  
- 🧬 Biomedical Engineering crossover stuff  
- 🧪 A few half-finished ideas and late-night code dumps  

Basically, this repo is a **mashup of what I’ve learned, built, and broken** throughout school. I’m keeping it all here for future reference and (eventually) organizing the best bits into a cleaner portfolio.

## 🗂 Structure (Kind Of)

Right now things might be a little scattered, but here’s a rough breakdown:
```
/Programming 2/
  └── coursework from course focused on object oriented Java programming
  
/Programming 3/
  └── Course following OOP, introduced GUIs and big data

/Systems & Networking/
  └── networking/
  └── security_labs/

/Biomedical Signals & Systems/
  └── signal_processing/
  └── matlab_stuff/

/Data Visualization/
  └── Coursework from DataVis: course covering the principles, methods, and techniques that are fundamental to information visualization
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

A lot of this code was written under deadline pressure, fueled by caffeine, and may not reflect best practices. Proceed with curiosity (and an open mind).
